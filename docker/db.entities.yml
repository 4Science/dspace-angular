    ### OVERRIDE default 'entrypoint' in 'docker-compose-rest.yml' ####
    # Ensure that the database is ready BEFORE starting tomcat
    # 1. While a TCP connection to dspacedb port 5432 is not available, continue to sleep
    # 2. Then, run database migration to init database tables  (including any out-of-order ignored migrations, if any)
    # 3. (Custom for Entities) enable Entity-specific collection submission mappings in item-submission.xml
    #    This 'sed' command inserts the sample configurations specific to the Entities data set, see:
    #    https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/main/dspace/config/item-submission.xml#L36-L49
    # 4. Finally, start DSpace
